# Safety Guidance (Draft)

Warning: Robots can cause injury. Proceed only if you understand and accept risks.

General
- Always use an accessible emergency stop (E‑stop).
- Current‑limit the first power‑up with a bench supply and inline fuses.
- Keep body parts clear of moving mechanisms.

Electrical
- Verify polarity and isolation before energizing.
- Use proper wire gauges and fusing per load.
- Secure looms; strain‑relieve moving joints.

Mechanical
- Deburr edges; cover pinch points.
- Validate clearances in CAD and with slow jogs.

Software
- Test code in simulation first where possible.
- Implement soft limits, watchdogs, and fault handling.

Documentation
- Record changes; keep BOM and wiring up to date.
